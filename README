               THE RHYMESTORE PROJECT
       
The Rhymestore Project provides Twitter integration to
"El Hombre de la rima f√°cil" and a management interface
to access the rhyme knowledge base. 


 1. Compiling Rhymestore
-------------------------

  Rhymestore can be compiled as a standard Maven project:
  
  $ mvn clean package
  
  That will generate the rhymestore.war file in the target/ folder.
  
  
 2. Deploying
--------------

  Once you have the rhymjestore.war file, you can deploy it to any
  servlet container.
